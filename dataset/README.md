# Parse-Ego4D dataset

Our dataset is split into three different files:

- `suggestions.csv` is the synthetic data generated by our LLM, Gemini Pro, that contains action suggestions for all snippets of Ego4D videos. The column `Ego4D VideoID` refers to the video ID in the Ego4D dataset which can be used to join this spreadsheet with the Ego4D dataset, in conjunction with the `Batch idx` and `Batch size`. 
- `annotations_raw.csv` contains the raw annotations from our human user study on Prolific. 
- `annotations.csv` contains the annotations aggregated per video snippet. This is the data used for all downstream ML tasks reported in the paper.

The common ID shared between all three spreadsheets is the `suggestion_id`. In addition, the `PARSE-Ego4D ID` provides a unique mapping to the Ego4D database.
